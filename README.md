# Brain Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having a brain stroke using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various health parameters of individuals, including:

- `id`: unique identifier 
- `gender`: "Male", "Female" or "Other" 
- `age`: age of the patient 
- `hypertension`: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension 
- `heart_disease`: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease 
- `ever_married`: "No" or "Yes" 
- `work_type`: "children", "Govt_jov", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed" 
- `Residence_type`: "Rural" or "Urban" 
- `avg_glucose_level`: average glucose level in blood 
- `bmi`: body mass index 
- `smoking_status`: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"* 
- `stroke`: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not
